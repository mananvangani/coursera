# Exercise 1 
# 
# Python: Python is one of the most popular and versatile programming languages for data science. It has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, such as Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch, which make it an excellent choice for data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning.
# 
# R: R is specifically designed for statistical computing and data analysis. It provides a wide range of packages for data visualization, statistical modeling, and data manipulation, making it a favorite among statisticians and data scientists.
# 
# SQL: SQL (Structured Query Language) is essential for working with databases. Data scientists often use SQL to retrieve and manipulate data stored in relational databases.
# 
# Julia: Julia is a high-level, high-performance programming language for technical computing. It is gaining popularity in the data science community due to its speed and ease of use for numerical and scientific computing.

# Exercise 2
# For Python:
# 
# NumPy: A fundamental library for numerical computing in Python, providing support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.

# 
# Statsmodels: A library that provides classes and functions for statistical models and hypothesis testing in Python.
# 
# For R:
# 
# ggplot2: A popular data visualization library in R based on the grammar of graphics.
# 
# dplyr: A powerful package for data manipulation, providing a concise syntax for filtering, arranging, summarizing, and transforming data.
# 
# tidyr: Works seamlessly with dplyr, offering functions for data reshaping and tidying.
# 
# caret: A comprehensive package for building machine learning models and performing model selection and evaluation.
# 
# lubridate: A package for handling date and time data in R.
# 
# randomForest: Implements random forest, a popular ensemble learning method, for classification and regression tasks.
# 
# glmnet: Provides functions for fitting regularized linear models using the Lasso or Elastic Net methods.
# 
# forecast: Focused on time series forecasting, offering various models and tools for time series analysis.

# exercise 7
# 
# 
# Arithmetic expressions involve basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. The order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) determines the sequence in which the operations are evaluated
# Addition:
# Subtraction:
# Multiplication:
# Division:
# Exponentiation:

# In[1]:


x, y = 10, 20;
z = x+y;
k=x*y;
